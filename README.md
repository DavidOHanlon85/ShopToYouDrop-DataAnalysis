<h1>Shop To You Drop - Data Analysis</h1>

Create a Java program to analyse some data on footfall in a shop.

Given the following 2D array ( below) representing the footfall of customers in a shop per hour, per day in a week (7 days). Write a program that will :

1.Display the total customer data for the week, day by day

2.Display the total number of customers for the week

3.Display the largest number of customers recorded during any hour of the week

4.Display each day with the total shopping hours (hours the shop was open that day)

5.Display the average customer number per hour for day (7 day week but the number of hours per day will vary)

<h2>Some hints</h2>

Add the 2D array to your main method. Then develop methods as appropriate for the tasks. Consider if you need to return data from a method - does it make it more flexible? e.g. a method that counts up all the customer data (task 2) would be best to return that value rather than print it out, but display all (task 1) would be best to display the data to screen and no return needed.

Each row represents a day, with each element in the row representing the number of customers in a given hour. The shop opens normally 8 hours a day but on some days that will vary.
